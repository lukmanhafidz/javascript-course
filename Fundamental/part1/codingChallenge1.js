/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

//data 1
let markMass = 78;
let markHeight = 1.69;

let johnMass = 92;
let johnHeight = 1.95;

let markHigherBMI = (markMass / markHeight ** 2) > (johnMass / johnHeight ** 2);

console.log("does mark is higher ? " + markHigherBMI)

//data 2
let markMass2 = 95;
let markHeight2 = 1.88;

let johnMass2 = 85;
let johnHeight2 = 1.76;

let markHigherBMI2 = (markMass2 / markHeight2 ** 2) > (johnMass2 / johnHeight2 ** 2);

console.log("does mark is higher ? " + markHigherBMI2)
